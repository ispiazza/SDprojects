I feel sure that among others we will all remember the wonderful Turkish dancers who introduced a new dimension to this Festival by their colourful and exciting performances. As for the 1989 Festival, hoping to meet both old and new participants, I look forward to the highly successful International Menuhin Violin competition, which has justifiably established Folkestone very clearly the gateway to Europe. Following this year's highly successful Folkestone/Hythe Festival Committee, we must learn to exploit this to our advantage.\",\n      \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Festival Committee who have worked so hard to make this year's Festival so very successful. The whole district, indeed the whole country, owes them a debt of gratitude for providing us with such delightful and colourful entertainment which can only further international friendship and understanding.\",\n      \"Civic Centre, Folkestone, 14th April 1989\",\n      \"GREETINGS\",\n      \"From the Festival President\",\n      \"For the past few months the media have been informing us that from 1992 Western Europe should be an area almost without frontiers. This festival has done even more over the past 28 years, for it has, every two years, broken down the barriers in life, music, dancing and, above all, friendship, have made this festival unique and this year is no exception. Each group and a return visit by our colourful friends from Poland. A first will be a group from the cradle of our civilization - Greece. The arrival of the Swedes, as always celebrate their Midsummer Pole. We'll enjoy more lively music from Portugal and warmly greet here again.\",\n      \"Such a marvellous diversity and mixing of cultures and above all such an atmosphere of friendship and happiness. However to make it happen requires hosts and in order to continue, also your support. Come to our concerts and I promise you will enjoy yourselves and help to keep being a festival that adds, we proudly, to better understanding of our fellow monks.\",\n     ",
